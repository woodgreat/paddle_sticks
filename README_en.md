Open-source Design Draft for a New Type of Chopsticks - Paddle Chopsticks

Paddle Chopsticks were created and released by wood, adhering to the document included in the release document: the Creation and Use License Agreement for the "Paddle Chopsticks" design.

The design intention of Paddle Chopsticks is to address the inconvenience of traditional chopsticks in handling certain shaped foods, such as instability and difficulty in gripping. This design aims to improve upon traditional chopsticks.

The improved paddle chopsticks are divided into three types:

Full Paddle Chopsticks
File Names: full_paddle_sticks__short_type__finish, full_paddle_sticks__finish

Half Paddle Chopsticks
File Name: full_paddle_sticks__short_type__finish

Mini Paddle Chopsticks
File Name: mini_paddle_sticks__short_type__finish

I have created prototypes for all three types of paddle chopsticks and conducted prototype user experience tests. Among them, the mini paddle chopsticks are the most suitable for daily use, while the other two types are more convenient in specific scenarios.

If you are interested in this design, you can consider producing and using mini paddle chopsticks.

If you have any good ideas or suggestions during production and use, and wish to communicate with me, please contact me at the following email address: 9731484@qq.com. I wish you a pleasant experience!
